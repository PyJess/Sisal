# GENERAL DESCRIPTION

## Purpose and Scope

The project that is the subject of this document aims to automate and simplify the management of the credit line of
points of sale.

The project will focus on developing an application designed to manage the credit limit for each\
retail customer, providing:

- Comprehensive visibility of the customer's credit status, with the ability to drill down into all business areas;

- A summary of the company's risk level;

- A single point of management for retail customer operations for the Finance function.

The application, called ZENIT, will have a graphical interface (back office) and allows the management of:

- Centralize credit management for all points of sale:​

  - Replace the fragmented and manual processes with an integrated and automated system, ensuring a more efficient and
    effective credit management process​;

  - Multibrand business platforms validate transactions through Zenit\'s central module, which handles credit limit
    verification and movement​;

- Provide a centralized real-time dashboard for full visibility and control​;

- Equip the Credit team with tools for real-time decision-making;

- Automate credit risk management and insight reporting;

- Provide a detailed credit analysis for each point of sale and product, enabling an optimised credit limit allocation
  through a dynamic category-based breakdown, ensuring compliance with product-specific limits;

Focus on Italy, on Sisal, to include approaches on multibrand integration scenarios ( i.e. SNAI ) and new domestic and
international tenders.

ZENIT will allow you to optimize credit management, reduce risks and support more effective strategic decisions.

The project includes three phases: 

1.  **Data Collection, Aggregation and Visualization**

2.  Actionable Services for Credit and Transaction Management

3.  Reporting and Predictive Analytics

This document describes the functionalities and use cases allowed by this application and the interactions with other
internal and external systems to meet **phase 1** of the project: **Data Collection, Aggregation and Visualization**.

The activities related to credit line management concern all Sisal Group PoS.

Following the new reorganization, the Sisal Group has identified two new channels containing all types of points of sale
in the network. The channels are:

- BRANDED: this channels represents all those points of sale which have clear evidence of the SISAL logo; this channel
  includes Shops and Direct Agencies which have the SISAL sign, or related trademarks, at the entrance to the shop; in
  addition to these are the Corners which have particular evidence of the SISAL brand.

- UNBRANDED: This channel, on the other hand, includes all those points of sale where the Sisal brand is not
  specifically in evidence compared to other operators in the sector.

The term \"Fido\" refers to the maximum exposure value (credit) authorized by the Credit team to a point of sale.

The identification of the category is reported in the data \"Canale 1\", which is calculated according to the following
rules:

# ANALYSIS OF FUNCTIONAL AND NON-FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS

The functionalities provided by ZENIT in Phase 1 consist of:

- **Automated data collection** from POS registries, gaming platforms, and document archives​;

- **Centralized dashboard** to show relevant credit information (e.g., financial data, credit ratings, \...)​​;

The system must manage the trusted customer in multi-brand mode, according to the FlutterSEA B2B retail master
classifications.

The following paragraphs describe the additional functional requirements with respect to the user requirements aimed at
improving various application aspects such as usability, error handling, audit and traceability, etc.

## RF001 - Initial Load and Data Migration

The system must allow the necessary data to be imported and migrated before the system is booted for operational use.
The system must support the initial loading of data from various data sources, including Excel files, CSVs, and existing
databases.

This process must ensure that the ZENIT system is fully populated with the necessary data, while maintaining data
integrity and quality.

## RF002 - Disconnected for inactivity

The system must manage the user logout in the event of prolonged inactivity to ensure security, prevent unauthorized
access, and optimize system resources.

## RF003 - Login Tracking (SOX)

The main system must record in detail all login activities in compliance with the company policies (SOX), tracking
critical information (such as user, login time, role\...). The dedicated team (e.g. \"Control Room\") will have to be
able to view, analyze and extract this information.

## RF004 - Log Tracking

The application must be SOX Compliance and use log traceability management.

## RF005 - Manage concurrency

The system is used by several users at the same time, so it must guarantee data consistency and manage concurrency.

## RF006 - Settings

Provide the user with a simple and accessible tool to customize the application interface according to:

- language preferences (such as English, Italian, etc.);

- display preferences (including font size and light/dark theme).

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The following functional requirement (from RF007 to RF009) are foreseen in Phase 2; we will manage to anticipate them
  in Phase 1 if feasible.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RF007 - Arxivar - Documents Acquisition

The system must be able to connect to the Arxivar service to automatically list the documents available for a specific
PoS, based on predefined criteria, such as the type of document and its status.

## RF008 - Dashboard - Single PoS - "Documents"

The system must provide, within the dashboard, the ability to view all documents associated with the selected POS,
regardless of their origin (Cerved or ARXivar). The user, by selecting a POS from the dashboard, must be able to access
a dedicated section where the documents retrieved from the two systems are listed.

## RF009 - View Borderò - ArchiCON

The system must allow the opening of a link with *ArchiCON*, thus enabling the viewing of the *Borderò* document
associated with a specific PoS. This operation must be performed directly from the dashboard.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The following functional requirement (from RF010 to RF011) have been identified during the analysis phase as
  appropriate for implementation, although not explicitly indicated by the user during the requirements gathering phase.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RF010 - Dashboard - Single PoS - "Notes"

This requirement states that, from the dashboard, once a point of sale (PoS) is selected, it should be possible to view
and enter specific notes. These notes can contain useful information for credit management, such as date, name, and
other relevant characteristics.

## RF011 - Import RedList

In the case of external/internal negative reports, insolvencies and/or unfulfilled payment promises, the PoS, after all
the necessary evaluations by the Credit Office, is included in a "Redlist" that provides for the limitation of credit
lines.

Currently, this \"RedList\" is sent by email from the Credit Office to BO Lottery and Betting with the excel file
attached ("RedList_Mm_yyyy.xlsx").

In phase 1, where there will be no automatisms and dispositive actions, the data of interest related to the RedList to
be integrated into ZENIT can be imported by uploading the relevant excel file.

The following data must be manually integrated from the excel file created by the Credit Office:

- IdRice;

- Zona Rice;

- Flag RedList (Si/No);

- General Reason;

- SIMP Management;

- SIMP Reason.

## Initial Load and Data Migration

### XPS-ZENIT-001 - Initial Load and Data Migration

The system must allow the necessary data to be imported and migrated before the system is booted for operational use.
The system must support the initial loading of data from various data sources, including Excel files, CSVs, and existing
databases.

The system must allow the initial loading of the following essential data:

- PoS Personal data;

- Cerved data;

- Types of Contract;

- RedList Data;

Additionally, it will be essential to retrieve historical data (rolling for the last 12 months) related to:

- Borderò Data;

- Unpaids Data;

Once the initial import of the \"PoS Personal Data\" to ZENIT is complete, you can proceed with the upload of the other
information.

The data relating to RedList and the Types of Contract can be uploaded using the import procedures already available in
the \"Massive Importer\" session.

All other data can be acquired through the data collection processes present in the Data Collection session.

## Data Collection

**[General premise]{.underline}**

- **Temporary Solution**

> It is specified that in all cases in which it will not be possible to carry out a direct integration of the
> information with the systems that own the data, in a timely manner, it will be necessary to proceed with the
> integration of the information by uploading the Excel files that today use the required data of interest.\
> This temporary solution will ensure the continuity of the process and allow you to keep the necessary information up
> to date until the direct integration is available.

- **Acquisition date**

> It is established that for each acquisition of data, it will be mandatory to record the date of acquisition. This
> information will be essential to ensure data traceability and allow accurate management of information over time.
>
> The acquisition date should be associated with each data, thus providing a useful time context for future analysis and
> to verify the freshness of the information.

made (Cerved report request) for the assessments on the PoS.

**[Cerved Clustering Parameter]{.underline}**

The Cerved Group Score is an indicator used by Cerved, one of the leading rating and commercial information agencies in
Italy, to assess the financial solidity and risk of a company. This score is based on various financial and operational
parameters of the company and is used to provide an evaluation of its economic health and credit reliability.

The Zenit system acquires the CGS (rating), which, based on the risk cluster, enables the assessment of the customer\'s
risk level and creditworthiness, and supports the credit line assignment process. 

In this table you will find the following information:

- **Rating (from/to)**: Range from the CGS score, which usually ranges from a minimum value (indicated as "from") to a
  maximum value (indicated as "to"). Higher scores indicate lower risk and greater robustness of the company;

  string, left-padded with zeros (e.g., \"MI0001\"). This data will only appear on "tickets paid at other sales points";

- **Amount bet**: the amount of the sell related to the bet.

- **Amount Won**: the amount of the prize paid.

The data acquired from the system must follow the same rules and logic currently in use for the daily extraction
performed by the DWH on the winnings monitoring reports. This process must ensure that the data is consistent, accurate,
and formatted according to existing specifications, maintaining the same frequency of daily extraction.

The data can be viewed, for each PoS, from the Dashboard in the: 

- Dashboard - Single PoS - "Winning Data" Tab; 

### XPS-ZENIT-120 - Terminal Data Acquisition

ZENIT takes the Terminal Data for each Terminal Type at each Point of Sale (PoS) from ORION.

The information that needs to be extracted are:

- **IdRice**: Unique PoS identifier;

- for each Terminal Type :

  - Type ID;

  - Type Name;

  - Number of Terminals: Quantity of Terminals for each Type at PoS;

The data can be viewed, for each PoS, from the Dashboard in the: 

- Dashboard - Single PoS - "PoS Master Data" Tab;

### XPS-ZENIT-130 - Cerved - Report Acquisition

## Login/Logout

### XPS-ZENIT-200 - User Profile Management

This use case describes which roles are allowed in the Dashboard and what each role can do.

It is required to set up at least the following different privilege levels:

- Full Access User, with access to all ZENIT features (consultation and extraction of data, massive import, threshold
  management);

- Operator User, with access to partial ZENIT features (consultation and extraction of data, partial management of
  thresholds);

- Observer User, with access to consultation and data extraction;

- IT Support, with read/only access to log information via splunk .

The user, after login, only accesses the functionality available to his profile.\
A user may have a privilege for one country and a different privilege for another country.

Each user will be placed in a group and each user group will have roles assigned to it for navigating the application
(groups such as Credit Manager, Credit Reporting, Italy Credit Team, Albania Credit Team).

For each functionality described in this document, it is therefore foreseen which role can be applied for each type of
user. For further information on the role/user/functionality mapping, please refer to [ZENIT - Features and Profiles
v1.0.xlsx](https://sisalgroup.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Cross-PlatformsSystems/Shared%20Documents/01.%20PJ/20.%20ZENIT/01.%20Docs/99.%20VARIE/ZENIT%20-%20Features%20and%20Profiles%20v1.0.xlsx?d=w140da528168541d0bf81412d72e201b8&csf=1&web=1&e=tM6bnM)

It must be possible for the user to close their session with the logout function.

When logging into ZENIT, it must be clear and unambiguous to the user in which environment they are operating, between
development, test, pre-production and production, in order to reduce human errors of operating in the wrong environment.

In the event of incorrect credentials being entered, a message must be returned to the user.

In compliance with company policies the passwords system is handled by Microsoft.

### XPS-ZENIT-203 - Login tracking (SOX)

The application must implement a tracking system that records every user access and interaction to ensure compliance
with SOX regulations. This information will be stored in a secure database and accessible only to authorized personnel.

Registration of access once authenticated, the system registers in the database least the following information:

- Username;

- Surname and First Name;

- email address;

- Title;

- Department;

- Date of Last Login;

- Status of the Username;

- Role;

### XPS-ZENIT-204 - Visualization Data Access Tracking

The dedicated team (such as "Control Room" - IT Support) must be allowed to view the login tracking information recorded
in the ZENIT system, using a dedicated app such as Splunk.

### XPS-ZENIT-210 - Manage concurrency

The system is used by several users at the same time, so it must guarantee data consistency and manage concurrency.

The system must support simultaneous access by multiple users, ensuring data consistency and integrity. Concurrency
management must be implemented to avoid conflicts and ensure that user operations do not interfere with each other.

### XPS-ZENIT-211 - Settings

It must be possible for the user to access a menu to change BO ZENIT settings.

Functions in this menu must at least include:

- Language selection (Italian, English ...);

  - The language selection determines not only the displayed texts, but also the format of dates and amounts:

    - If the user selects Italian, local formats will be used for dates (e.g., dd/mm/yyyy) and amounts (e.g., 0.000,00
      €);

    - If the user selects English, local formats will be used for dates (e.g., mm/dd/yyyy) and amounts (e.g., €
      0,000.00);

> In Phase 1, only the Italian language will be implemented.

- Theme style (light or dark);

- Font size (normal or large);

It will be possible to enrich this menu in the future with further functions, also at the suggestion of users.

## Log/Audit

### XPS-ZENIT-220 - Operations Tracking

The application must be SOX Compliance and use log traceability management, already in use on other Company
applications, which consists of inserting a particular log template, on all the logs relating to modification operations
on DB and File or logs relating to a specific action (e.g. validation).

This template must provide for the possibility of keeping these types of logs for longer than other application logs.

On the **description** of log use the following template:

> \#*\<applicationName\>*\# #AUDIT# \#*\<actionCategory\>*\# User '*\<username\>*' having role \'*\<userRole\>*\' has
> performed the following action: \<*actionDescription*\>

**Safety**: Tracking data must be protected from unauthorised access.

**Integrity**: The log must be immutable and non-modifiable once registered.

**Accessibility**: At this phase, the visibility of results will not be available to the authorized user. This
functionality may be considered in later phases of the project.

## Dashboard - Credit Management

**[General premise]{.underline}**

- **Mockup**

> The following analysis describes the interfaces in accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the business
> and documented in ZENIT - Dashboard Mockup. The layout and data aggregation logics may be subject to changes aimed at
> ensuring better modularization of components and optimized visibility based on access profiles.

- **Excel Export**

> This document describes the Excel export formats provided for the analyzed interfaces, including representative
> examples of the names used for data extractions. These examples are for illustrative purposes and may be subject to
> updates during the implementation phase.

|                       | 4.  If the search produces one or more results, the system displays the result               |
|                       |                                                                                              |
|                       | 5.  The results must be shown in a table or list with columns representing the various       |
|                       |     fields (IdRice, Company name ...). Each row in the table must represent a single PoS.    |

## Massive Importer

**[General premise]{.underline}**

- Massive Importer allows you to import into Zenit all those data that cannot be retrieved from internal or external
  systems. In this perspective, the Massive Importer function could be used to compensate for the initial lack of
  integration with certain systems; once the integration with the data owner system is activated, it will be possible to
  avoid importing that data using the Massive Importer. The import functionality, although still available, is
  deprecated and should be used only as a backup. 

- It is necessary to provide an informational message in case the user attempts to use the Massive Importer while the
  integration with the data owner's system is active. 

- It is mandatory that the excel file must maintain its original form, no changes to the structure or format of the
  cells are allowed, to ensure the integrity of the information and the consistency of the data during the import
  process.

- The names of the Excel files used for imports are those currently in use and may change over time. For further
  details, please refer to the attached Excel files mappings (*ZENIT - Excel files mapping* - the link to the file is
  available in the Appendix chapter), which contains the names of the files currently in use.

- The complete list of data to be imported for each file is included to the attached Excel files mappings (*ZENIT -
  Excel files mapping*). However, as the acquisitions become available through the source systems, the related data may
  no longer be subject to import. The import functionality, although still available, is deprecated and should be used
  only as a backup.

- The data to be imported is specified in an external file *ZENIT - Elenco Dati* that contains:

  - List of Excel files to import;

  - An indication of how the data in the file may be imported into the system:

    - **Manual**: the data may be manually uploaded by the user.

    - **Integration**: the data may be automatically acquired through integration with external systems.

    - **Both**: the data may be acquired both manually and via integration.

  - Data to import for each Excel file.

**[Template file]{.underline}**

The **Massive Importer** functionality allows the import of data from Excel files using predefined templates, aiming to
speed up the data loading process, automate information management in the system, and ensure data security.\
To simplify and accelerate the import process, an Excel template will be provided for each type of data to be uploaded.
This template will ensure a consistent structure that is easily importable into the system while also excluding any
sensitive data that might be present in certain Excel files.

Where applicable, it will be possible to use a custom Excel managed through a template created based on the current
Excel file used today by the Credit Office.

A standard Excel file, ready for use, will be provided for each import. Those who need to submit data must follow these
simple steps:

1.  Copy the data from their file into the provided template.

2.  Remove any formulas, leaving only static values in the file. To do this, use the \"Paste values\" option to remove
    formulas.

3.  Ensure that the file meets the following requirements:

    - Save the file in .xlsx format (not in .xls, .csv, or other formats).

    - Each column must adhere to the expected data format (e.g., numeric, text, date, etc.) as outlined in the template.

    - There should be no empty rows within the data block.

    - The file must contain only one worksheet.

    - The headers must be in the first row, exactly as in the template.

    - The structure must match the template exactly (number and order of columns, data type, etc.).

    - There should be no merged cells, pivot tables, or other advanced Excel elements.

Using these standardized templates not only makes data loading easier and faster, but by ensuring that no sensitive or
unnecessary data is imported, it guarantees safer and more compliant data management.

**[File size limitations]{.underline}**

There may be limitations on the file size (in MB). It is recommended to ensure that the file does not exceed a certain
size (for example, 15 MB). If the file is too large, a double submission will be allowed, splitting the data into two
separate files while still adhering to the structure and guidelines of the template.\
Exact specifications for file size management will be defined and refined during the implementation phase.

### XPS-ZENIT-500 - Massive Importer

It allows you to make massive changes to PoS and Credit Line information by importing a file with the data to be
updated. The file to be imported must have the data in the expected format. To facilitate the successful import of a
file with the required fields, in several cases, a template of the file to be filled in is provided, where the user
enters the required data and reloads the file to be used for the update.

The functionalities present are:

- Import RedList Data;

- Import Contract Types Corner - PGS;

- Import Contract Types Corner - PGI;

- Import Contract Types - AWP;

- Import Contract Types "Specializzati";

- Import RETINA;

- Import Profit and Loss - Shops;

- Import Profit and Loss - Gaming Hall;

- Import Profit and Loss - Corner;

- Import QR Corner Data;

- *Import Offline PoS Data Storage;*

- Import Tracking Winnings - Tickets paid at other agencies;

- Import Tracking Winnings - Unpaid winning SPORT tickets;

- Import Tracking Winnings - Unpaid winning VR tickets;

- Import AWP Another Dealer;

- Import DATABASE RETE;

- Import DB Corner;

- Import GNTN Credit Situation;

- Import Corner Credit Situation;

- Import Conti Gioco Credit Situation;

- Import SIMP Credit Situation;

- Import Cerved Data;

The individual functions listed are explained in detail in dedicated use cases.

The flow for massive update is as follows:

- Select the desired type of massive importer;

- Choice for the user between:

> a\) uploading an already compiled file;
>
> b\) download the template and after appropriate update, reload it (Step a)

- Start of the massive importer, with the relevant checks on the file and a summary of the updates that will be made
  (e.g. update required for 500 PoS).

- at the end of the update operation, evidence of successful and/or unsuccessful updates.

The system will perform a structural check of the file to ensure that the format complies with the required template and
that all mandatory fields are present. Subsequently, it will execute a validation on the contained data, checking that
the values are consistent with the established rules (formats, mandatory fields, data integrity).

Massive updates requested and completed (successful, KO or successful with errors) or only requested are collected in a
history section, which must contain the name of the file used and the summary of the outcome. Under the file import
form, there are the table with the results of the previous processing.

In the output file downloadable from the history, if errors are present they must be indicated in the ERROR DESC column
(e.g. \'PoS unavailable on DB\').

### XPS-ZENIT-501 - Import Red List 

In phase 1, where there will be no automatisms and dispositive actions, the data of interest related to the RedList to
be integrated into Zenit can be imported by updloading the reference excel file.

The excel file can be uploaded \"On Demand\" directly from the interface made available in ZENIT.

The reference excel file, today, created/maintained by the Credit Office is monthly:

- \"*REDLIST_M\<m\>\_\<yyyy\>.xlsx*\"

> (where *\<m\>* corresponds to the reference month number and *\<yyyy\>* the reference year)\
> This file contains all the PoS of the active network.

The information of interest listed in the requirements is all present on the \"DATABASE\" sheet.

The user will manually upload the excel by accessing the application in the \"Massive Importer\" section and selecting
\"*Import RedList*\".

The data can be viewed, for each PoS, from the Dashboard in the "Dashboard - Single PoS - "Risk Data" Tab.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  During the Zenit Phase 1, the Excel file must be uploaded in synchronization with those of systems GEO and SIMP, to
  ensure the best possible alignment.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XPS-ZENIT-502 - Import Contract Types Corner

The goal of this feature is to allow users to import information related to PGS and PGI type contracts into the ZENIT
system. The import occurs through an Excel file structured according to a standard template, prepared by the system and
distributed to users.

The original file produced by the BOA office, named "REV Rete Attiva \<ddmmyyyy\>" (\<ddmmyyyy\> = day, month and year
of reference), contains two sheets: one dedicated to PGI contracts and one to PGS contracts. However, this file cannot
be imported directly into the system. It is required that the user accesses the file received from BOA, extract the data
related to PGS and PGI contracts, and transcribe them into two separate Excel files, using the dedicated templates
provided by the system --- one for PGS contracts and one for PGI contracts --- while maintaining the structure required
by the system.

The user will manually upload two separate files by accessing the application in the \"Massive Importer\" section and
selecting the appropriate option:

- \"*Import Contract Types Corner* - PGS;

- \"*Import Contract Types Corner* - PGI;

If the validation is successful, ZENIT will update the contractual information for each point of sale, using ZONA RICE
as the reference key.

The data can be viewed, for each PoS, from the Dashboard in the "Dashboard - Single PoS - "Contracts" Tab.

### XPS-ZENIT-504 - Import Contract Types - AWP

The goal of this feature is to allow users to import information related to AWP type contracts into the ZENIT system.
The import occurs through an Excel file structured according to a standard template, prepared by the system and
distributed to users.

The original file produced by the BOA office, named "REV PV AWP \<*ddmmyyyy*\>" (\<ddmmyyyy\> = day, month and year of
reference), contains one sheet dedicated to AWP contracts. It is required that the user accesses the file received from
BOA, extracts the data related to AWP contracts, and transcribes it into the Excel template dedicated to AWP,
maintaining the structure required by the system.

The user will manually upload the excel by accessing the application in the \"Massive Importer\" section and selecting
\"*Import Contract Types - AWP*.

If the validation is successful, ZENIT will update the contractual information for each point of sale, using ZONA RICE
as the reference key.

The data can be viewed, for each PoS, from the Dashboard in the "Dashboard - Single PoS - "Contracts" Tab.

### XPS-ZENIT-505 - Import Contract Types - Specializzati

The goal of this feature is to allow users to import information related to Betting and VLT type contracts into the
ZENIT system. The import occurs through an Excel file structured according to a standard template, prepared by the
system and distributed to users.

The original file, named "ELENCO CONTRATTI PV SPECIALIZZATI.xlsx", contains multiple sheets: One of these sheets
contains contract types. However, this file cannot be imported directly into the system. It is required that the user
accesses the file, extracts the data related to Betting and VLT contracts, and transcribes it into the Excel template
dedicated to this Contract Types, maintaining the structure required by the system.

The user will manually upload the excel by accessing the application in the \"Massive Importer\" section and selecting
\"*Import Contract Types - Specializzati*\".

If the validation is successful, ZENIT will update the contractual information for each point of sale, using ZONA RICE
as the reference key.

The data can be viewed, for each PoS, from the Dashboard in the "Dashboard - Single PoS - "Contracts"" Tab.

### XPS-ZENIT-510 - Import RETINA

The goal of this feature is to allow users to import information related to PoS of the active network, (PoS Master Data
and weekly media collection for GNTN) into the ZENIT system. The import occurs through an Excel file structured
according to a standard template, prepared by the system and distributed to users.

The perimeter of the RETINA identifies the Stores potentially \"active\" for Sisal on the Sunday of the week just ended.
The RETINA considers the new openings and closures related to GNTN and Corner.

The original file produced weekly by the Business Analysis (BA) office, named "RETINA\_\<ww\>\_\<yyyy\>\_FdV
Q\<q\>1_senza_tg" (where \<ww\> is the week number, \<yyyy\> is the reference year, and \<q\> is the quarter number),
contains two sheets: one dedicated to PoS Data. However, this file cannot be imported directly into the system. It is
required that the user accesses the file received from BA, extracts the data related to PoS, and transcribes it into the
Excel template dedicated to RETINA Data, maintaining the structure required by the system.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  It is essential to also include the week number and year of reference for the data, as this information will need to
  be displayed on the dashboard.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The user will manually upload the excel by accessing the application in the \"Massive Importer\" section and selecting
\"*Import RETINA*\".

If the validation is successful, ZENIT will update the information for each point of sale, using IDRICE and ZonaRice as

## Back-End Procedure 

### XPS-ZENIT-600 - Daily historical archiving

A daily nightly snapshot of the data will be scheduled.

To ensure compliance with privacy regulations, it is necessary to delete data related to closed PoS that are not
currently active or that have been resolved for a configurable period, usually 10 years. However, this rule does not
apply to PoS under legal management or those that have recorded a loss transition in recent years. The PoS are those
that present a "status collection" in SAP (*XPS-ZENIT-102- SAP - "Status Collection" Data Acquisition*) or that appear
on the list of imported Offline PoS Data Storage(*XPS-ZENIT-520 Import Offline PoS Data Storage*).

If it is necessary to avoid the immediate permanent closure of the PoS --- as this could occur before any pending issues
are verified --- it will be appropriate to foresee a temporary logical closure. This closure, configurable for a
determined period, will prevent the display of the PoS and allow for any checks. After the defined period, the PoS can
be permanently deleted.\
\
**[Continuous and complete data storage]{.underline}**

- The data must be stored daily, without interruptions, starting from the beginning of the project and continuing for
  the entire duration of the project;

- Data history must be preserved continuously, preserving the historical sequence of information.

- The data storage should be labeled with the date and time of storage;

**[Historicization]{.underline}**

The data to be stored is specified in an external file *ZENIT - Elenco Dati V04.1.xlsx* that contains:

- The list of data to be stored (which and how much information should be kept);

- The type of archiving: daily, weekly, monthly for each data point (if required).

The system must be able to retrieve historical data and allow analysis to display any daily storage.

Data must be stored efficiently to ensure optimal performance.

The system must be scalable to handle large volumes of data and ensure that all daily storage can be retrieved easily.
