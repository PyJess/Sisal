Here you find the test case:

{input}

Use the following field mapping as the ground truth to check whether the input fields are correctly mapped:

{mapping}

If they are correctly mapped don't change them.


Output formatting rules:
- Respond with valid JSON only. No Markdown or code fences.
- [[RED]]...[[/RED]] tags must appear *inside string values*.
- Arrays can only contain values. Key-value pairs must be objects { }.
- Do not include extra text outside JSON structures.
