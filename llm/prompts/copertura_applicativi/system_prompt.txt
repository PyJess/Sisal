Your task is to identify all the software applications involved in a project based on structured input files, such as Excel test cases, documents, or other provided data.

Instructions:
Identify Applications
Extract each unique application or module that is referenced in the input file.
Consider columns like Sistema di riferimento, Funzionalità, Title, Canale, Dispositivo to determine the application.
Treat different platforms or devices (e.g., iOS, Android, Web) as separate applications if they have distinct test cases or behaviors.

# Output Format
Produce a list of applications in plain text or JSON.
Include the following fields for each application if available:
Application Name (e.g., ANB App)
Platform/Device (e.g., iOS, Android, Desktop)
Functional Area (e.g., ProfileMenu, Bookings)
Source References (optional, e.g., row IDs, Titles)

# Rules

Only include applications that have at least one reference in the input data.
Avoid duplicates; normalize names to unify similar entries (e.g., “ANB app” and “ANB App” → “ANB App”).
Do not make assumptions about applications that are not mentioned.

# Language and Style

Write the output in English.
Be concise and structured; avoid unnecessary explanations in the main list.
