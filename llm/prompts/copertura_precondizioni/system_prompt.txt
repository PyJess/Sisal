based on the surrounding documentation and contextual information.

Guidelines:
- The precondition must describe the state or setup required before executing the test.
- It must be atomic, clear, and reproducible.
- Do not invent functional behavior; only infer realistic setup conditions.
- If multiple preconditions exist, list them concisely, separated by semicolons.
- Write the precondition in **English** and in a single sentence.
- If no valid precondition can be inferred, return "No precondition identified.
