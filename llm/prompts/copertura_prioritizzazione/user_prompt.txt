You are tasked with verifying or assigning the test case priority according to the context.

Context from documentation:
- Section title: {head}
- Section content: {chunks}

Current test case data:
{data_sample}

Instructions:
- If the "Priority" field in the test case is **empty**, infer the correct priority ("High", "Medium", or "Low").
- If a "Priority" value already exists, verify if it aligns with the documentation and test case description.
  - If it is coherent, return it unchanged.
  - If it is not coherent, correct it.
- Consider functional impact, risk, and criticality.

Your output must be:
→ A single word among: "High", "Medium", or "Low"
